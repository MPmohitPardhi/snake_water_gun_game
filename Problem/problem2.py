# 1. Write a python program to add two numbers.

# a = int(input("Enter the number 1: "))
# b = int(input("Enter the number 2: "))


# print("The Sum Of Two Numbers is: ", a + b)

# 2. Write a python program to find remainder when a number is divided by z.


# a = int(input("Enter the number 1: "))
# b = int(input("Enter the number 2: "))

# c = a%b;

# print(f"Remainder when {a} is divided by {b} is {c}")

#Check the type of variable assigned using input () function.

# a = int(input("Check the type of variable"))

# print("print type ", type(a));


# 4. Use comparison operator to find out whether ‘a’ given variable a is greater than
# ‘b’ or not. Take a = 34 and b = 80


# a = int(input())
# b = int(input())

# print("find out", a > b);


# 5. Write a python program to find an average of two numbers entered by the user.
# num1 = float(input("Enter first number: "))
# num2 = float(input("Enter second number: "))

# # Calculate average
# average = (num1 + num2) / 2

# # Output
# print(f"The average of {num1} and {num2} is {average}")


# 6. Write a python program to calculate the square of a number entered by the user.


# # Input from user
# num = float(input("Enter a number: "))

# # Calculate square
# square = num ** 2

# # Output
# print(f"The square of {num} is {square}")
